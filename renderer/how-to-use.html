      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        Hey! My name is Lucas and this is just a little flashcard app I made
        with Electron to help study. I noticed quizlet had ads ads which I
        thought was stupid so I decided to just make my own app this is mainly
        just for fun but also since I made it I can make it look and do whatever
        I want. I'm going to make this free to use if anyone else wants to use
        it.

      <h1>Home Page</h1>
      <p>
        This is the Home Page. This is where you will be able to see all of your
        folders and sets, where you will be able to create new folders and sets,
        and where you will be able to edit previously created folders and sets,
        and where you will be able to select and study your sets you have
        created.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h2>New Folder</h2>
          <p>
            To create a new folder, just select the new folder button, you will
            be prompted to name your folder and then select done. Once you
            create your folder, you will able to select it, which will display
            its contents in the Sets window. By default new folders will always
            be empty at first.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>New Set</h2>
          <p>
            To create a new Set, you must have a folder selected for your set to
            go into, otherwise a popup will appear and let you know that you
            need to either select a previously created folder or create a new
            folder and select it. Once you have a folder selected and you select
            New Set, you will be first asked to name the set. Name the set and
            the select done. Once you have done this you will enter the edit set
            page and you will be able to add terms to your set. When you are
            done editing your set, select done and your set will be created.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h1>Edit Set Page</h1>
      <p>
        This is the edit set page, by default each set will have three blank
        cards that will appear on the page on the creation of a new set. These
        can be deleted if the user wants less cards, but you will be required to
        have at least one card in each set, even if it is blank. Cards are added
        to the new set page everytime the user selects the "new +" button. Cards
        can be deleted by selecting the "-" button on the top right of each
        card. When the user is done creating or editing their new set, they
        should select the "done" button at the bottom of the page. They will be
        prompted with a small window confirming that they want to create this
        new set to which they will say yes or no.
